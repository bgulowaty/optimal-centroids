# optimal-centroids

Source code for paper [Search-based framework for transparent non-overlapping ensemble models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9892360/) by [B.Gulowaty](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bogdan-Gulowaty) and [M.Wo≈∫niak](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michal-Wozniak-6).

## Building the package
Project uses poetry as build system. To install the package for usage in your local env, simply issue `poetry install`.

## Usage
```python
from optimalcentroids.optimal_centroids import run

# define variables
models = run(x_train, y_train, n_trees, max_tree_depth, pop_size, n_gen)
``` 

* Method `run` returns list of models. If, during the optimization process, pareto solutions were found, then the list contains all models based on the pareto front solutions. Otherwise, list contains single model. 
* Returned models are compatible with scikit-learn API.


Please refer to [this notebook](usage_example.ipynb) for more extensive usage example.

### Parallelization

The inner working are based on [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/) optimization library. 
Method `run` accepts `pymoo_elementwise_runner` keyword argument, which refers to [elementwise evaluation function](https://pymoo.org/problems/parallelization.html). Default one is `LoopedElementwiseEvaluation`.
